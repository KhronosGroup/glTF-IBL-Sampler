# glTF IBL Sampler

## Introduction

This project pre-filters an environment High Dynamic Range (HDR) panorama image and stores diffuse and specular parts in cube maps respectively. Considering different material characteristics, the specular part consists of several mip-map levels corresponding to different roughness values of the modeled material. The final basis compression into a [KTX2](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software/tree/ktx2) file ensures small file sizes while maintaining reasonable image quality.

<!--
The official Khronos [glTF Sample Viewer](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Viewer) is used to clarify, how e.g. a physically-based material has to be lit and rendered. In the [glTF 2.0 reference](https://www.khronos.org/files/gltf20-reference-guide.pdf), the default material model is the Metallic-Roughness-Model.

## Workflow

The individual transformations can be executed separately in the library, enabling the use of a cube map as input in future releases.  

* Environment HDR image &rightarrow; Cube Map  
* Cube Map &rightarrow; Filtered Cube Map  
* Filtered Cube Map &rightarrow; KTX2 Output File  

This separation of shader passes ensures both, flexibility and extensibility.
The pre-filtering will use the algorithms noted in the [glTF Sample Environments](https://github.com/ux3d/glTF-Sample-Environments) repository.

## Building

The project provides a cmake file to generate respective build files.

Third Party Requirements:

* Vulkan SDK
* Glslang (included in the Vulkan SDK)
* [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) image library (git submodule)
* [SlimKTX2](https://github.com/ux3d/slimktx2/) (git submodule)

CMake option ```IBLSAMPLER_EXPORT_SHADERS``` can be used to automatically copy the shader folder to the executable folder when generating the project files. By default, shaders will be loaded from their source location in lib/shaders.

The glTF-IBL-Sampler consists of two projects: lib (shared library) and cli (executable). 

## Usage

The CLI takes an environment HDR image as input. The filtered specular and diffuse cube maps can be stored as KTX1 or KTX2 (with basis compression).

* ```-inputPath```: path to panorama image (default) or cube map (if inputIsCubeMap flag ist set)
* ```-distribution```: choose sample distribution (either 'Lambertian' for diffuse, 'GGX' for specular, or 'Charlie' for sheen)
* ```-outputCubeMap```: output path for filtered cubemap
* ```-outLUT```: output path for BRDF LUT
* ```-sampleCount```: number of samples used for filtering (default = 1024)
* ```-mipLevelCount```: number of mip levels of specular cube map
* ```-cubeMapResolution```: resolution of output cube map (default = 1024)
* ```-targetFormat```: specify output texture format (R8G8B8A8_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_SFLOAT, R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT)
* ```-lodBias```: level of detail bias applied to filtering (default = 1 )
* ```-inputIsCubeMap```: if set, a cube map in ktx1 format is expected at input path 

Example

```
./cli.exe -inputPath ./input/chromatic.hdr -outCubeMap ./output/chromatic/charlie/sheen.ktx2 -sampleCount 1024 -distribution Charlie -mipLevelCount 9 -cubeMapResolution 1024 -targetFormat R16G16B16A16_SFLOAT
```
